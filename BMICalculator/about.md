#### What is BMI?

This application calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides an assessment of whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on your input parameters.

#### Calculating the BMI
BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:

> BMI = kg/m^2

where *kg* represents the person's weight and *m^2* the person's squared height.

#### About this BMI Calculator

This *BMI Calculator* is for adults 20 years and older. Further information on calculating BMI for children and teenagers is available from the CDC [2].
